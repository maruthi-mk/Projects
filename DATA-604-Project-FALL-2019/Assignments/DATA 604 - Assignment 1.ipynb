The technical metadata includes the system metadata, which defines the data structures such as tables, fields, data types, indexes and partitions in the relational engine, as well as databases, dimensions, measures, and data mining models.

This includes start time, end time, CPU seconds used, disk reads, disk writes, and rows processed. When troubleshooting the ETL or query process, this sort of data becomes valuable. Process metadata is the fact measurement when building and using a DW/BI system. Some organizations make a living out of collecting and selling this sort of data to companies - in that case the process metadata becomes the business metadata for the fact and dimension tables. Collecting process metadata is in the interest of business people who can use the data to identify the users of their products, which products they are using, and what level of service they are receiving._\n",

    "##### Advantages of Using Pandas dataframes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Pandas dataframes is much easier and efficient way of coding when compared to standard Python lists for querying or modifying data. Pandas data frames has more functionality than standard Python. Python lists are faster than Pandas DataFrames for small datasets (or for large datasets that are going to remain completely static and that you can allocate all up-front), whereas Pandas DataFrames are faster than Python lists for large datasets especially if you want to manipulate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are some of the advantages of the Pandas library <sup> [7] </sup>:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data representation:** It can easily represent data in a form naturally suited for data analysis via its DataFrame and Series data structures in a concise manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data subsetting and filtering:** It provides for easy subsetting and filtering of data, procedures that are a staple of doing data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Concise and clear code:** Its concise and clear API allows the user to focus more on the core goal at hand, rather than have to write a lot of scaffolding code in order to perform routine tasks. \n",
